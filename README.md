# Railway-Track-Fault-Detection-Journal

This is a journal paper in which we are proposing a new deep neural network architecture to identify faults in railway tracks to reduce accidents on railway tracks in Southeast Asia. Hundreds of people die every year due to railway accidents in countries like - Bangladesh, India, Srilanka, Pakistan, etc. manual Detection Syates are inefficient and time-consuming. Our proposed AI based architecture can classify defective and non-defective railway with an accuracy which is even greater than some of the state-of-the-art architectures like - VGG16, inceptionV3, etc. In this repository, you will find all the codes discussed in our paper.
